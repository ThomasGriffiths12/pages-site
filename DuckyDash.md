## About this project:
This project was created as part of an Technical Games Production module assignment completed during the second year of study of the Computer Games Programming degree I completed at Staffordshire University. <br>
The goal of this project was to produce and complete a small mobile game in a group over the course of a semester, as well as then pitch it to a professional studio for review.<br>
Our project titled Ducky Dash, is an endless runner style game programmed entirely in lua and works on android phones.<br>
In it you play as a duck and have to swipe the phone touch screen to avoid falling obstacles, gaining points as you go.<br>
There are multiple game modes in the game, including a short story mode with cutscenes, a local multiplayer mode where two players share the same screen, with one player drops obstacles as the other dodges and finally an endless mode where the player must avoid as many obstacles as possible without dying.

## What I worked on:
As part of the project there were multiple facets that I worked on, from concept and design, brainstorming potential monetisation avenues as well as assisting the other members of the group when necessary.<br> 
The main gameplay element I worked on however was the powerup system available in the endless mode of the game, where four different types of power up would drop at random intervals and once collected by the player would give them a temporary benefit, such as slowing down obstacles, doubling points gained, extra lives and invulnerability.<br>
These powerups can also be bought in an ingame store and activated by the player during gameplay if they require an immediate boost without needing to wait for a random drop that may not even be the powerup they need.<br>
