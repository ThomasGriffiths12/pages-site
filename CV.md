# Employment History:

## Agilent Technologies (11-month work placement) October 2017-August 2018:
Over the course of my placement at Agilent Technologies, I worked as a member of an R&D team and had to use C# to build several programs that could connect and transfer data between the program and Agilent’s hardware products. This placement provided me with valuable real-life work experience, such as participating in daily SCRUM meetings and working as part of a team, as well as building on my skills of C# and .Net further.

## SimCorp Coric Ltd (1-week work experience) July 2012:
During my one-week work experience I was tasked with learning how to use the company’s software and complete tasks set to me to test the software. As a result, this experience has improved my testing skills as well as my skills in adapting to changing circumstances, such as learning how to use different software in a short timeframe.

## Interests:

I enjoy regularly going to conventions, such as comic-cons, as they allow me to meet and socialize with people who enjoy the same hobbies and interests as I do. <br>
I enjoy puzzle solving, whether in a videogame, book or puzzle format, as it develops my problem-solving skills, which is useful to have as a programmer. <br>
I also enjoy collecting and building complex Lego sets as they help to express my creativity. <br>
I also enjoy playing videogames, as they provide me with experiences that I would be unable to obtain in a real-life environment and as such also help to fuel my creativity. <br>
